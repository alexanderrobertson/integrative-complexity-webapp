The political traditions of the United States and of Canada are from the same roots. Each of us has tried to build a society that gives first place to the individual man, his need, his hopes, his rights, his responsibilities. Our methods are in some ways different and our efforts on both sides less than perfect but on balance we can both claim some success in our dedication to the free society. We stand together also in our common dedication to the ways of peace and in our common determination to cooperate and prevail in the cause of freedom and fair dealing between nations. We stand together in the atlantic alliance which has proved itself to be the shield of a free world and in a United Nations which is groping toward a world brotherhood which in our nuclear jet propelled age has become an urgent necessity for survival itself.';
